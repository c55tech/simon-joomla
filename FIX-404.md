# Fix 404 Component Not Found Error

## Problem
Component is registered and enabled, but Joomla is using LegacyComponentDispatcher instead of the new MVC dispatcher. This means the service provider isn't being found.

## Solution: Reinstall the Component

The component needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled so Joomla can properly register the service provider.

### Step 1: Uninstall the Component

1. Go to: **Extensions → Manage → Extensions**
2. Filter by **Component**
3. Find **SIMON**
4. Select it (check the box)
5. Click **Uninstall** (top toolbar)
6. Confirm uninstallation

### Step 2: Clear All Caches

1. Go to: **System → Clear Cache**
2. Select **All** from the dropdown
3. Click **Delete**

### Step 3: Clear Autoload Cache (Important!)

Via DDEV terminal:
```bash
ddev ssh
rm -rf /var/www/html/cache/autoload_psr4.php
rm -rf /var/www/html/administrator/cache/autoload_psr4.php
```

Or manually delete:
- `/var/www/html/cache/autoload_psr4.php`
- `/var/www/html/administrator/cache/autoload_psr4.php`

### Step 4: Discover and Reinstall

1. Go to: **Extensions → Manage → Discover**
2. Click **Discover**
3. Find **SIMON** in the list
4. Select it
5. Click **Install**
6. Wait for installation to complete

### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Go to: **Extensions → Manage → Extensions**
2. Filter by **Component**
3. Find **SIMON**
4. Verify it's **Enabled**

### Step 6: Clear Cache Again

1. **System → Clear Cache → All → Delete**

### Step 7: Test

Try accessing:
```
https://simon-joomla.ddev.site:8443/administrator/index.php?option=com_simon&view=dashboard
```

## Alternative: Quick Fix Without Uninstall

If you don't want to uninstall, try this first:

### Clear All Caches Aggressively

```bash
ddev ssh
cd /var/www/html
rm -rf cache/*
rm -rf administrator/cache/*
rm -rf tmp/*
```

Then:
1. Go to: **System → Clear Cache → All → Delete**
2. Try accessing the component again

## Why This Happens

When a component is discovered/installed, Joomla:
1. Registers the component in the database
2. Caches the component structure (including service provider location)
3. Creates autoload files

If the component was installed before all files were in place, or if caches are stale, Joomla might not find the service provider and fall back to legacy mode.

Reinstalling forces Joomla to:
- Re-scan all component files
- Re-register the service provider
- Rebuild autoload caches
- Use the new MVC dispatcher
